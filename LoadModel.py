## 2 - Loading the trained model
#FaceNet is trained by minimizing the triplet loss. But since training requires a lot of data and a lot of computation, we won't train it from scratch here. Instead, we load a previously trained model. Load a model using the following cell; this might take a couple of minutes to run.
FRmodel.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = triplet_loss, metrics = ['accuracy'])
